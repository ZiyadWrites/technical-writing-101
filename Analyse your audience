How to analyse your audience

To gain a better understanding of who your audience is, you can start by creating an audience analysis grid:

| Question  |  Primary |  Secondary |
|------------  | ---------  | ---|
Who will read it? | 
What are their job functions? (List in full) | 
What is their level of expertise? (Especially technical expertise of a theoretical and practical nature) |
What do they need (Put this up front. Avoid assuming you know what they need) |
What is the bottom line info the document should contain (The parts they can't do without.) |
What are their biases and prejudgements? (The social, organisational, political context & their expectations.) |
What are their reading conditions? (PC or paper, noise level, privacy on the job) |
What other documents do they use? (You should use a format they are familiar with) |
